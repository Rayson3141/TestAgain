Hi, I'm Lucas, an electronics engineer, roboticist, classical guitarist, and autistic individual.

<img src="./assets/gitbook/images/profile.jpeg" alt="Lucas" style="float: right; margin: 0 50px 20px 30px; border-radius: 50%; width: 200px; height: auto; object-fit: cover;">

I'm a senior Machine Learning Engineer at Hurb, a Brazilian travel company. I lead the experimentation program, developing a culture of experimentation within the company. 

Starting this fall, I will be a master's student at the University of Alberta, where I will focus my research on reinforcement learning.

I began writing as a way to deepen my understanding of the topics I was studying, approaching them as if I were explaining them to myself. This blog is a reflection of that journey, a place where I can share my passion for learning and exploration. Here, you'll find my thoughts on various topics, from reinforcement learning and robotics to statistics and beyond.

Whether you're a fellow researcher, a curious student, or someone with a love for learning, I hope you'll find value in my writings. Feel free to reach out with questions, suggestions, or collaboration ideas. Make yourself at home.
