<p>During my second year of medical school, my mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She hid her pain until she was no longer able to bear the symptoms. The burden of adding another bill to her already strained budget was the primary reason my mother waited to seek medical care. We were fortunate that her specific cancer had an excellent prognosis, however, had her cancer been addressed earlier there would not have been a need for the drastic steps that followed. While I was fortunate to be born into a community with multiple excellent healthcare options, that does not mean its access is extended to everyone. A familyâ€™s socioeconomic status plays a crucial role in their ability to access healthcare as well as to when care is sought in the first place. My family, like many other low-income families, has frequently delayed care due to the fear of being unable to afford another bill. How can you think of what you want when you hardly have what you need? As a physician, an intimate understanding of the social determinants of health and barriers to care are key in my ability to provide the best care for my future patients.</p>
