*A website detailing my past, present, and future work.*

<h3> PS</h3>

<p>It is tough for a mother to raise three children. It is even more difficult when she has to do so without the help of partner. Force her to support these children on a job paying nearly minimum wage and it becomes nearly impossible. Being the eldest child, I took on the role of a father figure at a young age. I spent most of my childhood needing to be a good example for my siblings while attempting to stay ahead of a seemingly endless number of problems too big for me to fix. Little time was left to see “The American Dream” as anything more than a few words on a homework assignment. The crippling pressure of living paycheck-to-paycheck, having to juggle even the most basic access to power, water, and food, was a feeling I knew well growing up and one I know many people feel today. This mutual understanding of income being a barrier to health, as well as my own personal desire to help fix the problems of those around me, are the roots of my aspiration and determination to become a physician.</p><br>

<p>Similarly, internal medicine can also be a puzzle. Like the math problems I spent entirely too much time on in college, problems in medicine may not have a set path and may not have an adequate solution. These problems may be acute in nature or they may be a lifelong struggle. Multiple variables may present themselves at any time and it may take multiple attempts to succeed. This challenging variability, along with a need for persistence, is what I find most exciting and why I have chosen to pursue medicine.<br>
Education is one of the most important ways I was able to overcome my beginnings. I developed a passion for educating others starting as a tutor in high school and continuing as a peer mentor in college and in medical school. I have continued to demonstrate my commitment to improve the overall health education of the public by being an advocate for the education of my peers. The abundance of opportunities to teach, be taught, and make a direct impact on the lives of those who truly need it is what I want most out of my career in medicine. My goal during my time in residency is to further my own education through direct patient care and diligent practice in order to better educate those who need it.</p><br>

<p>During my second year of medical school, my mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She hid her pain until she was no longer able to bear the symptoms. The burden of adding another bill to her already strained budget was the primary reason my mother waited to seek medical care. We were fortunate that her specific cancer had an excellent prognosis, however, had her cancer been addressed earlier there would not have been a need for the drastic steps that followed. While I was fortunate to be born into a community with multiple excellent healthcare options, that does not mean its access is extended to everyone. A family’s socioeconomic status plays a crucial role in their ability to access healthcare as well as to when care is sought in the first place. My family, like many other low-income families, has frequently delayed care due to the fear of being unable to afford another bill. How can you think of what you want when you hardly have what you need? As a physician, an intimate understanding of the social determinants of health and barriers to care are key in my ability to provide the best care for my future patients.</p>
