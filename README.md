## About Me

Hi, I'm Lucas! I'm a senior Machine Learning Engineer at Hurb, a Brazilian travel company, and starting this fall, I will be a master's student at the University of Alberta. As an electronics engineer, roboticist, classical guitarist, and autistic individual, I try to be as precise as possible in my writing, but feel free to contact me to suggest any changes.

I began writing as a way to deepen my understanding of the topics I was studying, approaching them as if I were explaining them to myself. This blog is a reflection of that journey, a place where I can share my passion for learning and exploration.

Through my writing, I hope to inspire others to dive into the fascinating worlds of reinforcement learning, robotics, statistics, and beyond. Feel free to reach out with questions, suggestions, or collaboration ideas. Thank you for visiting, and make yourself at home.
