I am Martin Funkquist, currently a PhD student at Linköping University. My research is within the field of AI, with a focus on sequential decision making and learning. I am interested in creating autonomous agents that can autonomously learn how to act in a complext environment. Our current approaches involve combining Deep Learning and Symbolic AI that can learn symbolic models of the world, which can be used for planning and decision making. 

### Short bio
I did both my Bachelor's degree in Simulation Technology and Virtual Design and Master's degree in Computer Science at KTH. After working a few years as a Software Engineering consultant and doing a research internship at TU Darmstadt I am now a PhD student in the Machine Reasoning Lab and work on the Representation Learning for Acting and Planning project.
