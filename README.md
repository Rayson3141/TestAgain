## About Me

Hi, I'm Lucas! I'm a senior Machine Learning Engineer at Hurb, a Brazilian travel company, and starting this fall, I will be a master's student at the University of Alberta. As an electronics engineer, roboticist, classical guitarist, and autistic individual, I bring a unique perspective to everything I do.

I began writing as a way to deepen my understanding of the topics I was studying, approaching them as if I were explaining them to myself. This blog is a reflection of that journey, a place where I can share my passion for learning and exploration.

Through my writing, I hope to inspire others to dive into the fascinating worlds of reinforcement learning, robotics, statistics, and beyond. Whether you're a fellow researcher, a curious student, or just someone with a love for knowledge, make yourself at home.
