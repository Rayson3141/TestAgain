## Introduction

# Introduction to Experience Management Post Interaction and Post Call Surveys
> Experience Management is a next-gen tool that facilitates post interaction surveys and outcomes. It allows you to track and measure customer satisfaction using anchor metrics like Net Promoter Score (NPS), Customer Effort Score (CES), and Customer Satisfaction (CSAT). Webex Contact Center brings in an integration of Experience Management for its post call survey interactive voice response (PCS IVR) and digital channels.
