My name is Juan. I was born and raised in Colombia, but I have been living in the Netherlands since 2011. 

# Work Experience
I am an Analytics Engineer consultant at Xebia Data (9 years of experience working with data). I enjoy both the human and technical challenges of making organizations data driven. 

My ideal working week involves learning new technologies, writing difficult functions, teaching organizations about data, and networking at a Meetup.
