## Intern


**COVID-19 Chest X-ray Classification**, Nanyang Technological University
*Research Intern, Advisor: Dr. Teoh Teik Toe*
Jul 2021- Sept 2021

+ Developed a CNN-based detection and classification model based on deep learning algorithm.
+ Compared the classification results of various pre-trained models (such as VGG-16, DenseNet-121, and ResNet-50) using the technique of transfer learning.
+ Implemented an 18-layer convolutional neural network based on the architecture of ResNet.
+ Improved accuracy from 88.40\% to 93.02\% by substituting max pooling layers and ReLU activation function with average pooling layers and LeakyReLU.
